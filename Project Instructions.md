## **Objective**:
We are building a web app that can take PDF documents as input and respond to queries based on the content of the PDFs. We will be using the **Gemini 1.5 Flash model**, which is capable of parsing multi-modal documents (e.g., PDFs with text, tables, images, etc.) due to its ability to both "see" and "read" the document content.

## **Key Features**:
1. **PDF Upload & Caching**: The web app should allow users to upload PDF documents. These PDFs will be cached to avoid reprocessing them every time a query is made.
2. **Query Processing**: Users will input a query related to the uploaded PDF, and the system should return a relevant response based on the cached PDF.
3. **Multi-modal Processing**: Leverage the multi-modal capability of the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to handle PDFs with a mix of text, tables, and images.
4. **Simple Query System**: Initially, the system will process one query at a time without retrieving the entire conversation history.
5. **Context Caching**: Use context caching for the PDF document to improve performance by avoiding reprocessing on each query.

## **Documentation & Code**:
- **Example Code**: The project will reference the code in the file `Gemini_PDF.ipynb`, which contains both the Gemini API interaction and the context caching implementation.
- **Context Caching Documentation**: There is additional documentation for context caching in the file `Context_Caching_Formatted.md`, which should be followed for properly setting up caching mechanisms for the PDFs.

## **Development Components**:
1. **Backend**:
   - **PDF Upload API**: Create an endpoint that accepts PDF uploads, caches them using Geminiâ€™s context caching system, and stores them for subsequent queries.
   - **Query API**: Develop an API to accept user queries, retrieve the cached PDF, and return relevant answers using Gemini's model without reprocessing the PDF.

2. **Frontend**:
   - A simple UI to allow users to upload PDFs and input queries. The results should be displayed based on the responses from the backend.

3. **Model Integration**:
   - Integrate the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to handle multi-modal document processing.
   - Use the code from `Gemini_PDF.ipynb` to interact with the Gemini API and handle both PDF parsing and caching.

## **Initial Testing**:
For initial testing purposes, process one query at a time without conversation history retrieval. Later iterations can consider adding chat window functionalities and history retrieval if needed.
